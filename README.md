# CRUD-console-application
This is my first CRUD application. I have learned many things, i.e working with JDBC, SQL requests and so on. 
I have learned about DAO pattern. I worked with MySQL database. 

Created an application that allows to save, read, update, delete fields in Patients Database.
I had a great fun doing this project.
